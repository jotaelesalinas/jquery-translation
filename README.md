I've been cleaning GitHub and I found this gem... my first GitHub repo. In fact, my first git repo.

It didn't even have a README.

So many things have changed since 2012... How could I live without git back then? Folders named my-project-v1, my-project-v2, my-project-final, my-project-final-v2...

Thank you, GitHub!
